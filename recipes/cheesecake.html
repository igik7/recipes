    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>cheesecake, a dessert consisting of a thick, creamy filling of cheese, eggs, and sugar over a thinner crust and topped with sweet or sometimes salty items.    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (128g) graham cracker crumbs, 9 to 10 whole graham crackers, crushed</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (28g) confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>5 1/3 tablespoons (74g) butter, melted</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>two 8-ounce packages (452g) cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2/3 cup (152g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>teaspoon King Arthur Pure Vanilla Extract</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Step by step</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Select a pie pan whose inside top dimension is at least 9", and whose height is at least 1 1/4". Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.</li>
    <li>To make the crust: Stir together all of the crust ingredients, mixing until thoroughly combined.</li>
    <li>Press the crumbs into the bottom and up the sides of the pie pan, making a thicker layer on the bottom than on the sides.</li>
    <li>To make the filling: Mix together the room-temperature cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Mix in the eggs and vanilla, again mixing until smooth. To avoid beating too much air into the batter, use a mixer set at low-medium speed. To avoid lumps, make sure the cream cheese is softened, and/or at room temperature.</li>
</ol>
